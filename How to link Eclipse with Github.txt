Paste this to the URI place in eclipse. There, username etc. automatically fills. Under the Authentication title there (in Push Branch Master window) it asks for a password (this is the token).

Then, click "Personal access tokens" on the left column; below that, click Tokens(classic). Click "Generate new token" on the right side. -> "Generate new token(classic)". Click 'use your password'.

Copy the token, go eclipse's 'Push Branch Master' window, under Authentication title, paste the token to 'password' field. Press 'Preview'. Press 'Preview' again. Press 'Push' button. After a few seconds, push to github will be done.
